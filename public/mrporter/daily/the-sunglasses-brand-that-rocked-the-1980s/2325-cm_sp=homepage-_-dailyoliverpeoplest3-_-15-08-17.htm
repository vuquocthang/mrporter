If you don’t believe us, think of Mr Arnold Schwarzenegger, glowering on the poster of 1984 <a href="../five-grown-up-sci-fi-films/1531/index.htm">sci-fi classic</a> <em>The Terminator</em>, in a pair of enormous, square, wraparound frames.

Back then, the brand’s secret weapon was a cache of <a href="../vintage-menswear-we-would-wear-today/792/index.htm">vintage</a> sunglasses – all at least 50 years old – that co-founder Mr Larry Leight acquired in the late 1980s. It featured thousands of unworn filigreed and rimless frames from some of America’s most iconic optical brands. It was in this treasure trove that Mr Leight found his future brand name, Oliver Peoples, written on a receipt (he guessed Mr Peoples must have been the original producer or distributor) and a wealth of inspiration for his own, classy designs, which, shortly after launch, were being plastered across the pages of stylish magazines worldwide.</p></div></div><!-- react-empty: 44 --></article></div><div class="feature-daily-nav" data-reactid="45"><div class="daily__sidebar" data-reactid="46"><div class="daily__sidebar--latest tab active" data-reactid="47"> LATEST</div><div class="daily__sidebar--popular tab is-hidden" data-reactid="48"> MOST POPULAR</div></div><div class="daily-bar" data-reactid="49"><ul class="daily-items" data-reactid="50"><li class="daily-item" data-reactid="51"><a class="daily-item-link" href="../how-to-manage-your-money-the-modern-way/2482/index.htm" data-reactid="52"><div class="daily-item-image-div" data-reactid="53"><img class="daily-item___image resrc" role="presentation" data-src="http://cache.mrporter.com/journal-images/production/a19a8b0d-db7f-4384-83a3-f681b1bf9096" data-reactid="54"/><noscript data-reactid="55"><img className="daily-item___image" src=../../../cache.mrporter.com/journal-images/production/a19a8b0d-db7f-4384-83a3-f681b1bf9096/index.htm- /></noscript></div><div data-reactid="56"><p class="daily-item___title" data-reactid="57">How To Manage Your Money The Modern Way

It featured thousands of unworn filigreed and rimless frames from some of America’s most iconic optical brands. It was in this treasure trove that Mr Leight found his future brand name, Oliver Peoples, written on a receipt (he guessed Mr Peoples must have been the original producer or distributor) and a wealth of inspiration for his own, classy designs, which, shortly after launch, were being plastered across the pages of stylish magazines worldwide."},"flags":{"alignment":"left"}},{"format":"1.1","container":"TEXT","type":"BODY_COPY","payload":{"body":"In the ensuing decades, Oliver Peoples glasses continued to reign as the frames of choice for the Hollywood elite.

I’ve witnessed someone do an interview from their bedroom before – I’m not entirely sure what that says about them.” Always test your <a href=\"https://www.mrporter.com/mens/lifestyle/cameras\">camera</a> and microphone before you make the call to ensure the picture and volume settings are correct. “Practising for a Skype interview will also have a noticeable impact on your confidence,” explains Dr Stephen Fletcher, director of The Occupational Psychology Centre. “As will simply imagining yourself being <a href=\"https://www.mrporter.com/daily/five-habits-of-successful-and-famous-men/1205\">successful</a>.” Or to quote the inimitable Mr Abraham Lincoln, “Your own resolution to succeed is more important than any other.”<br /><br /><br />"},"flags":{"alignment":"left"}},{"format":"1.1","container":"TEXT","type":"HEADLINE","payload":{"body":"4.

Otherwise make sure you’ve cleared your diary and shut yourself away to minimise interruptions from inquisitive household pets. “People also forget to turn their mobiles off on a regular basis,” Mr Soden says. “It can upset the flow – even if they’re just silencing an incoming call.”<br /><br /><br />"},"flags":{"alignment":"left"}},{"format":"1.1","container":"TEXT","type":"HEADLINE","payload":{"body":"5.

Mr Soden agrees: “You can always get a sense of what kind of a person they are from their general demeanour. Are they fidgety or relaxed, articulate or shy? At <a href=\"https://www.mrporter.com/journal/the-workplace/which-boss-are-you/1424\">senior management</a> level it’s more about the personality fit than career experience, so this makes it all the more important to see how the candidate behaves on screen.” Eye contact is also key to establishing a good rapport; by positioning the video window next to the webcam lens you can see your interviewer and look them straight in the eye. “Sitting slightly forward with your arms open shows engagement with your interviewer,” Dr Fletcher advises. “Don’t be laid-back – in either sense – because that could be misinterpreted as disinterest in the interview.”<br /><br /><br />"},"flags":{"alignment":"left"}},{"format":"1.1","container":"TEXT","type":"HEADLINE","payload":{"body":"6.

Albeit only at weekends, or when walking the <a href=\"http://www.mrporter.com/journal/the-report/doggy-style/261\">dog</a> in the evenings. I would never wear this combination to the office. (If you happen to work at KITH’s head office, however, it’s part of the dress code. Each member of staff and each visitor checks his/her <a href=\"http://www.mrporter.com/mens/shoes\">shoes</a> at the door for a pair of slides.) <br /><br /> I believe this look was popularised by professional athletes who, when not performing (before, after or during games) like to give their feet a breather. But because athletes’ feet are generally pretty gnarled from the rigours of performing in too-tight shoes, they prefer not to expose the horrors – hence the socks. The <a href=\"http://www.mrporter.com/mens/shoes/sneakers\">sneaker</a> community embraced the look. Then fashion brands did likewise as part of the current high-meets-low movement. (<a href=\"http://www.mrporter.com/mens/designers/gucci\">Gucci</a>’s pool slide has been a bestseller for MR PORTER this summer.) The look became a fixture on <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/mrporterlive/?hl&#61;en\">Instagram</a> and stuck. <br /><br /> If you’re going to do it, there are some rules. Firstl you must own it. Wear your slides with confidence. Secondly, be practical: this is a fairweather summer look or an indoors look. <br /><br /> Also, you can’t clash your brands. If you are wearing the most classic of pool slides, the <a href=\"http://www.mrporter.com/mens/designers/adidas_originals\">adidas Originals</a> navy-and-white three-stripe – aka <a href=\"http://www.mrporter.com/mens/adidas_originals/adilette-striped-velvet-slides/888661?ppv&#61;2\">Adilettes</a> – then you mustn’t wear <a href=\"http://www.mrporter.com/mens/designers/nike\">Nike</a> socks with them, for example. You might get lynched in the street by a <a href=\"http://www.mrporter.com/journal/aficionados/the-sneaker-collector/178\">sneakerhead</a>. <br /><br /> Fresh white ankle socks work best. The socks must be pristine rather than off-white, threadbare or “delasticated”. They can have a band of colour around the ankle, but socks with contrast colours at the heel and/or toe will not work. And bear in mind what your day has in store. Trudging around town all day in exposed white socks will become troublesome rather quickly."},"flags":{"alignment":"left"}},{"format":"1.1","container":"TEXT","type":"HEADLINE","payload":{"body":"Try these"},"flags":{"style":"style_2"}},{"format":"1.1","container":"PID_LIST","type":"PID_LIST","payload":{"title":null,"pids":["883895","941416"],"url":null}},{"format":"1.1","container":"MEDIA","type":"IMAGE","subType":"MAIN_IMAGE","payload":[{"caption":"","alt":"","pids":[],"uris":{"standard":{"full":"http://cache.mrporter.com/journal-images/production/eb345e20-29fe-4882-a97f-2c0a542ade06","width":1200,"height":1,"flags":{"gallery":true}}}}]},{"format":"1.1","container":"MEDIA","type":"IMAGE","subType":"MAIN_IMAGE","payload":[{"caption":"","alt":"","pids":[],"uris":{"standard":{"full":"http://cache.mrporter.com/journal-images/production/17452c2b-f04b-4d3a-acf3-ecd81b5387be","width":1600,"height":213,"flags":{"gallery":true}}}}]},{"format":"1.1","container":"TEXT","type":"BODY_COPY","payload":{"body":"<strong>Are pocket squares still a thing?<br /><br /> From Mr Tom Mangan via email <br /></strong>"},"flags":{"alignment":"left"}},{"format":"1.1","container":"MEDIA","type":"IMAGE","subType":"MAIN_IMAGE","payload":[{"caption":"","alt":"","pids":[],"uris":{"standard":{"full":"http://cache.mrporter.com/journal-images/production/eb3fc918-c6bd-4e58-a79b-fb35c39b2794","width":1600,"height":213,"flags":{"gallery":true}}}}]},{"format":"1.1","container":"TEXT","type":"BODY_COPY","payload":{"body":"I understand where the question comes from. <em>Mad Men</em> brought the pocket square back from the moth-balled fringes of affected dapperness and made it mainstream. But then, just as quickly, it nearly killed it again through over-exposure. Just about every guy in a <a href=\"http://www.mrporter.com/mens/clothing/coats_and_jackets\">jacket</a> was wearing one, but not always well. Pocket squares became a sartorial crutch that ticked the box of “making an effort”. The fizzle and pop of the accessory went flat. <br /><br /> But perhaps we’ve come full circle. I still believe pocket squares absolutely have their place (that place being one’s breast pocket), so long as they are worn well and judiciously.  <br /><br />With pocket squares, there are two main acceptable options: the straight edge – a crisply folded half inch of pocket square that pokes neatly out of the breast pocket (this looks especially smart with a classic white cotton pocket square worn with a sharp <a href=\"http://www.mrporter.com/mens/clothing/suits\">suit</a> and tie) – or the casual tuck (pinch the handkerchief from the middle and loosely tuck in the four hanging corners). This is a more louche affair that works well with <a href=\"http://www.mrporter.com/mens/clothing/blazers\">blazers</a> or suits worn with or without a tie. I prefer a matte cloth in a dark or muted pattern, preferably from <a href=\"http://www.mrporter.com/mens/designers/drakes\">Drake’s</a>, but a pop of bright colour and/or pattern is no bad thing. A pocket square should never directly match your tie but it can coordinate with a minor colour in the tie or perhaps with a colour in your socks.

The idea that one should not wear black and navy blue together is probably another one. I say “probably” because I can see the validity of arguments on both sides.<br /><br /> If you’re going to do it, you need to make sure it looks deliberate. I would not, for example, wear black suit trousers with a navy blazer – it could give the impression you got dressed in the dark – but the combination can look very elegant. I have a midnight-blue <a href=\"http://www.mrporter.com/mens/clothing/tuxedos\">tuxedo</a> with black grosgrain lapels and I feel like the contrast helps to elevate the look. It’s a subtle twist on a classic.<br /><br />Worn casually, the colour combination can also help to soften the impact of an all-black outfit, which can look a bit rocker or goth, depending on how you style it. Wearing a pair of indigo blue <a href=\"http://www.mrporter.com/mens/clothing/jeans\">jeans</a> with a black leather biker jacket, for example, changes the overall impression. A pair of black jeans with a navy-blue <a href=\"http://www.mrporter.com/mens/clothing/coats_and_jackets/bomber_jackets\">bomber</a>, or vice versa, often works well as a <a href=\"http://www.mrporter.com/journal/dress-code/how-to-nail-smart-casual/410\">smart-casual</a> look.<br /><br /> However, it is true that black is not the easiest of combination colours to get along with. It’s certainly not as friendly as navy blue, which pretty much goes with everything. Black obviously works fine within the monochromatic spectrum of greys and white, but it doesn’t always go with brown or blue. You need to try it and see how it feels. I don’t often mix black with blue, or black with brown for that matter, because it just looks off to my eye. It’s not wrong though – it just comes down to personal preference."},"flags":{"alignment":"left"}},{"format":"1.1","container":"TEXT","type":"HEADLINE","payload":{"body":"Try these"},"flags":{"style":"style_2"}},{"format":"1.1","container":"PID_LIST","type":"PID_LIST","payload":{"title":null,"pids":["914155","517410"],"url":null}},{"format":"1.1","container":"TEXT","type":"BODY_COPY","payload":{"body":"<strong>Keep up to date with <em>The Daily</em> by signing up for our weekly email roundup.

Do we really need to tell you how useful a pair of boots can be, especially in <a href=\"http://www.mrporter.com/journal/the-edit/winter-is-coming/71\">winter</a>, when the wind starts to nip at your ankles? No. So let’s not dwell on it, and instead give you a brief overview of the greatest (and latest) pairs to land on MR PORTER."},"flags":{"alignment":"left"}},{"format":"1.1","container":"PID_LIST","type":"PID_LIST","payload":{"title":"THE CHELSEA BOOT","pids":["909914","897084"],"url":null}},{"format":"1.1","container":"TEXT","type":"BODY_COPY","payload":{"body":"While these appealingly minimal slip-on boots from <a href=\"http://www.mrporter.com/mens/designers/common_projects\">Common Projects</a> will truly come into their own when temperatures start to plummet, they’re also the kind of thing you can wear all year round. Pair with some <a href=\"http://www.mrporter.com/mens/clothing/jeans/skinny_jeans\">skinny jeans</a> for a more rock ’n’ roll-inspired look, or, if you’re very much feeling the earthy tones and hippy-ish vibes on offer from <a href=\"http://www.mrporter.com/mens/designers/prada\">Prada</a>, you could also opt for some heavy <a href=\"http://www.mrporter.com//mens/clothing/trousers/cords\">corduroys</a> (one of the coming season’s key trends), such as these from <a href=\"http://www.mrporter.com/mens/designers/tomas_maier\">Tomas Maier</a>."},"flags":{"alignment":"left"}},{"format":"1.1","container":"PID_LIST","type":"PID_LIST","payload":{"title":"THE LACE-UP BOOT","pids":["907517","915802"],"url":null}},{"format":"1.1","container":"TEXT","type":"BODY_COPY","payload":{"body":"Though much of the current menswear line from Parisian brand <a href=\"http://www.mrporter.com/mens/designers/balenciaga\">Balenciaga</a> is steeped in uber-cool irony, thanks to the influence of its creative director, <a href=\"http://www.mrporter.com/mens/designers/vetements\">Vetements</a> founder Mr Demna Gvasalia, there’s no double entendre to these smart and elegant boots, unless you count their deep colour, a rich brown patinated with black pigment. Look sharp by pairing them with a pair of wool <a href=\"http://www.mrporter.com/mens/clothing/trousers\">trousers</a> from Prada which, with their thick <a href=\"http://www.mrporter.com/journal/the-classics/dig-the-new-tweeds/135\">tweed</a> fabric, will provide a nice textural contrast."},"flags":{"alignment":"left"}},{"format":"1.1","container":"PID_LIST","type":"PID_LIST","payload":{"title":"HIKING BOOTS","pids":["915556","907427"],"url":null}},{"format":"1.1","container":"TEXT","type":"BODY_COPY","payload":{"body":"OK, we’re going to call these <a href=\"http://www.mrporter.com/mens/shoes/boots/hiking_boots\">hiking boots</a> but please, please, don’t actually go <a href=\"http://www.mrporter.com/journal/on-the-road/the-worlds-best-hikes-for-beginners/1293\">hiking</a> in them. Though they might well withstand the associated terrain and elements, they’re far too beautiful to be subjected to such treatment. Imagine how horrified <a href=\"http://www.mrporter.com/journal/the-interview/why-mr-tom-ford-gets-up-earlier-than-you/463\">Mr Tom Ford</a> himself would be if he found out. One of his trademark giant lattes would no doubt be hitting the floor very soon indeed. Instead, use them to toughen up your weekend look by pairing them with some selvedge denim <a href=\"http://www.mrporter.com/mens/clothing/jeans\">jeans</a> and a shearling or suede <a href=\"http://www.mrporter.com/mens/clothing/coats_and_jackets\">jacket</a> (or a combination of both, as in this example from <a href=\"http://www.mrporter.com/mens/designers/brunello_cucinelli\">Brunello Cucinelli</a>).
