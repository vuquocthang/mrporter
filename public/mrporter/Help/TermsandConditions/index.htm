<h3>ELIGIBILITY TO PURCHASE</h3>
<p>In order to make purchases on the Site you will be required to provide your personal details. In particular, you must provide your real name, phone number, e-mail address and other requested information as indicated. Furthermore, you will be required to provide payment details that you represent and warrant are both valid and correct and you confirm that you are the person referred to in the Billing information provided.</p>
<p>The Site is available only to individuals and others who meet the MR PORTER terms of eligibility, who have been issued a valid credit/debit card by a bank acceptable to MR PORTER, whose applications are acceptable to MR PORTER and who have authorised MR PORTER to process a charge or charges on their credit/debit card in the amount of the total purchase price for the merchandise which they purchase. MR PORTER reserves the right to restrict multiple quantities of an item being shipped to any one customer or postal address.</p>
<p>
By making an offer to purchase merchandise you expressly authorise us to perform credit checks and where MR PORTER feels necessary, to transmit or to obtain information (including any updated information) about you to or from third parties, including but not limited to your credit/debit card number or credit reports (including credit reports for your spouse if you reside in a community property jurisdiction), to authenticate your identity, to validate your credit/debit card, to obtain an initial credit/debit card authorisation and to authorise individual purchase transactions.

<h3>ORDERS</h3>
<p>All orders are subject to acceptance and availability, and items in your shopping basket are not reserved and may be purchased by other customers.</p>
<p>MR PORTER offers products for sale that are in stock and available for dispatch from our distribution center. Occasionally however, we may be waiting for shipments from our designer suppliers. Consequently you may from time to time be given the possibility of making an Advance Payment for certain items in which case you are able to make an Advance Purchase. This will ensure that you receive this item in priority once designer stock has been delivered to MR PORTER. MR PORTER will only take Advance Purchase orders for stock that has been scheduled for delivery by a designer supplier. Your rights regarding Advance Purchase are the same as those for any other purchase at MR PORTER. Alternatively, you may simply choose to register your email address for notification of arrival of the selected merchandise not held in stock.</p>
<p>Items received into stock may be pre-allocated to satisfy Advance Payment orders and customers making Advance Payments will receive items in priority to customers on the Waiting List or customers ordering through the Site for immediate delivery. Please be aware that we may be unable to deliver selected Advance Payment merchandise due to production problems or quality check issues identified when we receive an order into stock. In these circumstances we will notify you by email and refund the Advance Payment to your credit/debit card within thirty days of being advised that merchandise has become unavailable.</p>
<p>If you have registered your email address for notification of the arrival of a specific product featured on our Site, we will attempt to notify you by email within 48 hours of the product becoming available on the Site. Please be aware that on occasion certain products that are in particularly high demand will sell out during this period.

<br /><br />MR PORTER will store a record of your transactions for a minimum of one year.

<h3>PRICING POLICY</h3>
<p>Prices shown on the Site are in GBP or Euros and are inclusive of VAT at the applicable rate unless you have selected an alternative country where VAT is not chargeable, as indicated in the top left hand corner of the Site.</p>
<p>All prices and offers remain valid as advertised from time to time. The GBP or Euros price of a product displayed on the Site at the time the order is accepted will be honoured, except in cases of patent error.</p>
<p>From time to time, prices are subject to change in response to currency exchange rate changes, markdowns and other commercial factors.  The price applicable to your order will be the price current at the time your order is accepted.</p>
<p>Customers purchasing from a country served as DDP will incur relevant import duty and tax. These costs are included in the final purchase price. Customers purchasing from a country served as DDU will be charged for the items purchased and shipping costs only. Import duty or tax costs will be invoiced to you directly from DHL or an import broker appointed by you. We recommend you contact your local customs authority to determine a landed cost price prior to purchase completion.</p>
<p>If you are a customer whose credit/debit card is not denominated in Sterling or Euros, the final price will be calculated in accordance with the applicable exchange rate on the day your card issuer processes the transaction. </p>

<h3>SALE PRICE ADJUSTMENT POLICY</h3>
<p>MR PORTER is happy to offer a Sale Price Adjustment on items purchased up to 7 days prior to the commencement date of a sale. Please be aware that the exact style and size of an item must be available for purchase at the time your request is made before any adjustment in the sale price can be approved. All approved Sale Price Adjustments will be credited to your MR PORTER account in the form of a store credit which will be valid for 12 months. </p>
<p>We are unable to offer price adjustment on items originally purchased in a sale or on any special promotion items that are temporarily reduced in price. Once an item has been purchased at a discounted sale price, no price adjustment will be offered should the item be further marked-down.</p>

<a name="6"></a>
<p class="first-line">
<h3>ACCEPTANCE OF YOUR ORDER</h3>
<p>Once you have made your choice and your order has been placed, you will receive an email acknowledging the details of your order. This email is NOT an acceptance of your order, just a confirmation that we have received it.</p>
<p>Unless you cancel your order, acceptance of your order and completion of the contract between you and MR PORTER will be completed when we email you to confirm the goods have been dispatched. The sale contract is therefore concluded in London, England and the language of the contract is English. Neither our third party payment processor nor our nominated courier has the authority to accept an order on behalf of MR PORTER.</p>
<p>We reserve the right not to accept your order in the event, for example, that we are unable to obtain authorisation for payment, that shipping restrictions apply to a particular item, that the item ordered is out of stock or does not satisfy our quality control standards and is withdrawn, or that you do not meet the eligibility criteria set out within the TOS.</p>
<p>We may also refuse to process and therefore accept a transaction for any reason or refuse service to anyone at any time at our sole discretion. We will not be liable to you or any third party by reason of our withdrawing any merchandise from the Site whether or not that merchandise has been sold, removing, screening or editing any materials or content on the Site, refusing to process a transaction or unwinding or suspending any transaction after processing has begun. </p>
<p>Whilst every effort is made to make sure details on our website are accurate, we may from time to time discover an error in the pricing of products.  If we discover an error in the pricing of a product in your order, we will let you know as soon as possible.  We shall be under no obligation to accept or fulfil an order for a product that was advertised at an incorrect price and reserve the right to cancel such an order that has been accepted or is in transit. If you order a product that is priced incorrectly for any reason, we will email or telephone you to inform you that we have not accepted your order and/or that the relevant part of your order has been cancelled.  If you have already paid for the goods, we shall refund the full amount as soon as we are able. In the event that products are recalled in transit, we will process your refund once the products have been returned to us. </p>

<h3>PAYMENT</h3>
<p>Payment can be made by Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Maestro and JCB cards, and any other methods which may be clearly advertised on the Site from time to time. You can also choose to pay with PayPal. When selecting this option at checkout, you will be directed to the PayPal site to 'Log In' and review the amount shown before clicking 'Pay Now'. Once this transaction is complete, you will then return to MRPORTER.COM. Payment will be debited and cleared from your account upon dispatch of your order by MR PORTER. You confirm that the credit/debit card that is being used is yours or that you have been specifically authorised by the owner of the credit/debit card to use it. All credit/debit card holders are subject to validation checks and authorisation by the card issuer. If the issuer of your payment card refuses to authorise payment to MR PORTER, we will not be liable for any delay or non-delivery.</p>
<p>We take reasonable care to make our Site secure. All credit/debit card transactions on this site are processed using Datacash, a secure online payment gateway that encrypts your card details in a secure host environment. If you are a registered MR PORTER user, we will securely store your credit/debit card details on our systems. These details will be fully encrypted and only used to process card transactions which you have initiated.</p>
<p>To help ensure that your shopping experience is safe, simple, and secure, MR PORTER uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. Furthermore, we take reasonable care, in so far as it is in our power to do so, to keep the details of your order and payment secure, but in the absence of negligence on our part we cannot be held liable for any loss you may suffer if a third party procures unauthorised access to any data you provide when accessing or ordering from the Site.

<h3>INSURANCE AND DELIVERY</h3>
<p>You will own the goods on and from the later of the point in time when: (a) we receive payment in full, or (b) we deliver the goods to you. </p><p>MR PORTER insures each purchase during the time it is in transit until it is delivered to your specified delivery address. We require a signature for any goods delivered, at which point responsibility for your purchased goods passes to you. If you have specified a recipient who is not you for delivery purposes (for example as a gift) then you accept that evidence of a signature by them (or at that delivery address) is evidence of delivery and fulfilment by MR PORTER, and transfer of responsibility in the same way. The goods are your responsibility from the time we deliver them to the address you gave us.</p>

<p>DHL can deliver an order to certain destinations without collecting a signature. If this option applies to your shipping address, the signature opt out will be set by default; however, you can update your preference on the shipping page before proceeding to purchase. Please note, that if no signature is collected, you agree to our terms and conditions and, confirm that MR PORTER can leave your package(s) outside the premises at the shipping address provided by you without obtaining a signature for proof of delivery. Please be aware, that if no signature is collected, you agree to our terms and conditions and take full responsibility for any loss or damage that may occur. On occasion, DHL may refuse to deliver your order if they are of the opinion that the shipping address is considered to be unsafe.</p>

<p>Please note that we aim to dispatch all orders within 24 hours, or 48 hours during sale periods. Delivery times appearing on the Site are estimates and are to be used as a guide only and commence from the date of dispatch. In any event, we will deliver the goods to you within 30 days of the day on which we accept your order. MR PORTER is not responsible for any delays caused by destination customs clearance processes. If delivery is delayed by any event outside of our control, we will contact you as soon as possible to let you know and we will take steps to minimise the effect of the delay.  Provided we do this, we will not be liable for delays caused by the event, but if there is a risk of substantial delay you may contact us to cancel your order and we will give you a refund for any goods you have paid for but not received.</p>

<h3>RETURNS AND EXCHANGES</h3>
<p><strong>CANCELLING YOUR ORDER UNDER THE CONSUMER CONTRACTS (INFORMATION, CANCELLATION AND ADDITIONAL CHARGES)  REGULATIONS 2013</strong></p>
<p>If you are based in the EU under the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013 (ICACRs), you have the right to cancel your order with us provided you give us written notice.</p>

<strong>Right to Cancel under the ICACRs</strong>

<p>You have the right to cancel your order within 14 days without giving any reason.</p>
<p>The cancellation period will expire 14 days from the day after the day on which you (or someone you nominate, other than a carrier) receives the last of the goods.</p>
<p>To exercise the right to cancel, you must inform us by letter to:  Notice of Contract Cancellation, Customer Care Department, MR PORTER DC1, Unit 3, Charlton Gate Business Park, Anchor and Hope Lane, London SE7 7RU, or by email to: <a href="mailto:customercare@mrporter.com">customercare@mrporter.com</a>.  You may also use the <a href="../../mrporter/content/2014/email/order_confirmation/A4_cancellation_form.pdf" title="cancellation form">cancellation form</a>, but it is not obligatory.<p>
<p>For orders cancelled under the ICACRs, we will issue you with a full refund including the shipping cost paid by you. We may make a deduction from the reimbursement for loss in value of any goods supplied, if the loss is the result of unnecessary handling by you.</p>

<p>We will make reimbursement without undue delay, and not later than:</p>

<p>(i) 14 days after the day we receive back from you any of the goods supplied; or</p>
<p>(ii) (if earlier) 14 days after the day you provide us with evidence that the good have been returned; or </p>
<p>(iii) if no goods were supplied, 14 days after the day on which we are informed about your cancellation.</p>

<p>We will make reimbursement using the same means of payment as you used for the initial transaction, unless you have expressly agreed otherwise; in any event, you will not incur any fees as a result of the reimbursement.</p>
<p>In the event that we have sent goods to you and you have cancelled your order, we may withhold reimbursement until we have received the goods back or you have supplied evidence of having sent the goods back, whichever is the earliest. If we do not receive the cancelled goods back, we may arrange to have them collected from you at your cost. </p>
<p>You shall return cancelled orders to: MR PORTER DC1, Unit 3, Charlton Gate Business Park, Anchor and Hope Lane, London SE7 7RU, without undue delay and in any event not later than 14 days from day on which you communicate your cancellation of the contract to us. The deadline is met if you send the goods before the period of 14 days has expired.</p>
<p>You will have to bear the cost of returning the goods.</p>

<p>You are only liable for any diminished value of the goods resulting from the handling, other than what is necessary to establish the nature, characteristics and functioning of the goods.</p>
<p>Please note you may only use your right to cancel the order under the ICACRs if you give us formal written notice of cancellation any time after your order has been placed, up until 14 calendar days from the day after you receive your order, by email or post as described above.</p>
<p>Our FREE COLLECTIONS SERVICE (see below) is not available for orders cancelled under the ICACRs.</p>

<p><strong>RETURNS AND EXCHANGES USING OUR FREE COLLECTION SERVICE</strong></p>
<p>As an alternative to using your rights under the  ICACRs, you may prefer to return or exchange items using our free returns and exchanges collection service. You must request your exchange or return and send your unwanted items back to us within 28 days for a refund of the value of the item only, or an exchange on the same item in a different size, based on stock availability.</p>
<p>Please refer to our <a href="../ReturnsAndExchanges/index.htm">Returns & Exchanges policy</a> for further information. </p>
<p>Shipping is complementary on the replacement item, but exchanges made to destinations outside of the EU will be processed for customs clearance and therefore any relevant import duty and tax charges will apply. If you selected PayPal when you placed your order, any applicable taxes and duties on your exchange should be paid with your debit or credit card. See costs for <a href="../ShippingRatesAndPolicies/index.htm">Shipping</a> and <a href="../ReturnsAndExchanges/index.htm">Returns</a>.</p>
<p>Please note our free collection service is not available for orders cancelled under the ICACRs.  </p>

<h3>Our policy</h3>
<p>Items should be returned unused and with all MR PORTER and designer garment tags still attached. Returns that are damaged or soiled will not be accepted and will be sent back to the customer and/or a refund refused.</p>
<p>Where provided, belts and any designer packaging such as authenticity cards, dust bags, and leather tags should be included with your return.</p>
<p>Please email <a href="mailto:customercare@mrporter.com">customercare@mrporter.com</a> if any of your purchases have been delivered without MR PORTER tags.</p>
<p>All returns should be requested before you send your item(s) back to us to allow for easy identification and prompt processing. Unidentified returns will be returned to the sender.</p>
<p><strong>Shoes</strong></p>
<p>All shoes should be tried on a carpeted surface before wear. </p>
<p><strong>Underwear & Swimwear</strong></p>
<p>Boxers, briefs, and swimwear should be tried on over underwear. Returns will not be accepted if items are soiled, and will be sent back to the customer. </p>
<p><strong>Faulty goods</strong></p>
<p>Goods are classified as faulty if they are received damaged, or where a manufacturing fault occurs within six months of purchase. Please note that items that are damaged as a result of wear and tear are not considered to be faulty. If your item is faulty when you receive it, you can return it for a refund. Simply request a return through your account and send the faulty goods back to us within 30 days of receiving your order.</p>
<p>If you discover a fault after this time, but within six months of purchase, you can still return it. Where possible, we will offer to repair the item. If it cannot be repaired and the same product is still available, we will send you a replacement. If the same product is no longer available, you are entitled to a full refund. </p>
<p>If you would like to exchange a faulty item instead of obtaining a refund, please be aware that we can only replace it for the same product in the same size, subject to availability.</p>
<p><strong>Colours</strong></p>
<p>We have made every effort to display as accurately as possible the colours of our products that appear on MR PORTER. However, as computer monitors vary, we cannot guarantee that your monitor's display of any colour will be completely accurate.</p>

<p><strong>REPEATED RETURNS</strong></p>
<p>We offer a flexible returns policy to make your online shopping experience even easier. However, customers returning items repeatedly may be refused at our discretion.</p>
